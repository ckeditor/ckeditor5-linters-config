Changed import rules of `stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules`

Previously, specific plugins had to be imported in stylelint config:

```
"plugins": [
    "stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules/lib/license-header"
],
```

Now, the whole package has to be imported instead:

```
"plugins": [
  "stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules"
],
```

Using the rules is unchanged:

```
"rules": {
  "ckeditor5-rules/license-header": [ ... ]
}
```
