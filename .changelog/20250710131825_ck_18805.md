The way how the rules from the `stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules` package are loaded has been changed.

Previously, each rule had to be imported in Stylelint config directly:

```
"plugins": [
    "stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules/lib/license-header"
],
```

Now, the package exports all the rules, so it can be loaded instead of providing each rule separately:

```
"plugins": [
  "stylelint-plugin-ckeditor5-rules"
],
```

The way rules are configured remains unchanged:

```
"rules": {
  "ckeditor5-rules/license-header": [ ... ]
}
```
